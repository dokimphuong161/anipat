        review: ' I know for a fact my bun is happier here. My bunny would come home stressed from our old vet, he would hide and it would take him about a day to recover after dropping him off. I thought this was completely normal. However, since we switched vets, my bun has experienced 0 post vet stress, and actually happily eats hay on the car rides home. This is a change. Very happy.',

        review: ' All staff members are very caring, friendly, compassionate and professional. They have always fit me in when there was an emergency. Their care and knowledge of exotic pets is the best. They all follow up on all their cases. I have been taking my guinea pigs and rabbits there for at least 15 years and have  always been satisfied.',

        review: ' I was able to get my puppy in the same week, which was not possible any where else. Your staff has an obvious love for animals and is very kind and informative. Artemis eagerly awaits the peanut butter treats, and your distraction methods help keep her calm. Thank you!',

        review: ' I have three ferrets, two who are both bandit patterned. The vets, vet techs, and reception take great care to ensure they know who is who. They are always kind when working with my pets and listen to how to make the experience easier on everyone to get through the exams and vaccines. I love this office and staff!',
